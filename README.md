A MailGun Email Client


The goal of the project is to make a reactive email client/dashboard based around MailGun's API.

Admins would be able to configure domains to use within the application, as well as give out email addresses to users. 

Users would be able to
log into the application with the assigned email address and basically do normal email things (i.e view mail, as well as send and receive mail).


The application would define web hooks within MailGun to receive mail which the application would route client side to the recipient to see immediately.

The plan is to also include a plugin system that can be used to perform actions when emails are sent or received.
